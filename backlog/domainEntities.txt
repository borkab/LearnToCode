Domain Entities

Domain entities are a fundamental concept in software architecture, 
particularly in the context of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). 
Understanding domain entities and their role in the system is crucial 
for designing robust and maintainable software.

Domain entities are objects that encapsulate the business logic and 
data of a specific domain. They represent the core concepts and rules 
of the business domain and are central to the functioning of the system. 
Domain entities are characterized by their identity, which distinguishes them 
from other entities, and their behavior, which defines how they interact 
with other parts of the system.

Key Characteristics of Domain Entities
Identity: 
Each domain entity has a unique identity that distinguishes it from 
other entities. This identity is often represented by a unique identifier (e.g., an ID).
Behavior: 
Domain entities encapsulate business logic and behavior. 
They are not just data containers but also define the rules and operations that can be 
performed on them.
Consistency: 
Domain entities ensure that the business rules and constraints are consistently applied
across the system.
Lifecycle: 
Domain entities have a lifecycle that includes creation, modification, and deletion. 
They manage their own state and transitions.


Role of Domain Entities in the System

Encapsulation of Business Logic: 
Domain entities encapsulate the business logic and rules of the domain. 
This ensures that the business logic is centralized and not scattered across the system.

Data Integrity: 
By managing their own state and behavior, domain entities help maintain data integrity 
and consistency. They enforce business rules and constraints, preventing invalid states.

Separation of Concerns: 
Domain entities separate the business logic from other concerns such as data persistence, 
user interface, and external services. This separation promotes modularity and makes 
the system easier to maintain and evolve.

Collaboration: 
Domain entities collaborate with other entities and services to perform complex 
business operations. They interact with each other through well-defined interfaces 
and protocols.

Reusability: 
Domain entities are reusable across different parts of the system. They can be used in 
various contexts and scenarios, promoting code reuse and reducing duplication.


Best Practices for Working with Domain Entities

Rich Domain Model: 
Design domain entities to be rich in behavior, not just data containers. 
Encapsulate business logic within the entities.

Immutability: 
Where possible, make domain entities immutable to ensure data consistency and thread safety.

Validation: 
Implement validation logic within domain entities to enforce business rules and constraints.

Collaboration: 
Define clear interfaces and protocols for how domain entities collaborate with each other 
and with other parts of the system.

Testing: 
Write unit tests for domain entities to ensure that the business logic is correct and 
consistent.
